Summary:
Created modules that enables a program to send and receive direct messages to another user
on the DSP platform. I incorporated these modules into a graphical user
interface (GUI) using Tkinter that should allow any student to communicate with any
other student in this class as long as they know each other usernames.

Instructions:
When the user runs the program (a5.py), the user will be prompted to login with user, password,
and server. However, the user can create their account there, and the server is not needed to
login either. The program automatically runs the GUI, and the user can add contacts, message contacts,
and is prompted with received messages if any have come in.
